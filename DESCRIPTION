Description: The standard acf and pacf functions return biased estimates of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.  This packages masks these functions (and the ar function) from the stats package to allow users to encorporate the unbiased estimates of these quantities in their analyses without changing their original code.  Backwards compatibility is maintained via "penalized=FALSE" arguments.
